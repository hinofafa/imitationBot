Weâ€™re going to create a chatbot framework and build a conversational model for an island moped rental shop. The chatbot for this small business needs to handle simple questions about hours of operation, reservation options and so on. We also want it to handle contextual responses such as inquiries about same-day rentals. Credit by gk_ https://chatbotsmagazine.com/@gk_
